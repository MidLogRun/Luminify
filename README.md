# Luminify
HCI-Spring-24 Group Project
information we should know as the course staff (1 paragraph max)
including a very rough breakdown of your process and division of labor
e.g. "We met, A & B took the lead on Req's, everyone participated in our ideation session, B wrote out the scenarios, we all built paper prototypes and liked C's the best."

Milestone 2:
  We met via zoom every Thursday to discuss possible requirements gathering. Our problem space of choice was people in their late teens/20s making it easier to gather interview research. John created surveys that basically queried whether or not an individual has experienced Seasonal Affective Disorder in the past 5 years. We both asked our peers in CS/nonCS classes to help fill out these surveys and selected 3 individuals at random to further interview. Our ideas for what possible effective treatments we could create began out of what we gathered in these interviews. Matt got to creating scenarios for Luminify which John sketched out. ultimately we chose Figma prototypes. Our paper prototypes turned out to be highly efficient so we stuck with those. Week to week, we both contributed equally of what we could to the project.
